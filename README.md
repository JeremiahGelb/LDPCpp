# LDPCpp
MOST RECENT FULLY FUNCTIONAL COMMMIT:

"Move more functionality to ldpc.cpp" - look at RunMe.cpp for example use

This is a little project I did for fun after taking a class on error control coding.

Couldn't have done this without great instruction and ppt slides from Dr. Brian Hughes :)

I did this project to understand belief propogation a little better, and to teach myself c++.

This is my first c++ project and also first time implementing belief propogation, so feel free to contact me with any comments or suggestions.

I will probably add more features and documentation soon.
